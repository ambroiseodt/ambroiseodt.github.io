I am a Ph.D. student at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab & Inria, supervised by Pr. <a href="https://rtavenar.github.io/research/bio.html">Romain Tavenard</a>, Pr. <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Laetitia.Chapel/">Laetitia Chapel</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://ievred.github.io/">Ievgen Redko</a>. My research aims to better understand LLMs and transformers, notably under distribution shifts and in OOD generalization.

My contributions in these areas have appeared in top-tier machine learning venues such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AISTATS, ICASSP, have been recognized with an ICML Oral Award, a NeurIPS Spotlight Award, a Best Flash Talk Award at QBIN, and were featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/11/11/revealing-secrets-of-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-via-old-fashioned-markov-chain-mathematics/">Forbes</a>.

I have delivered invited talks at leading institutions, including EPFL, ENS Ulm, ENS Lyon, ENS Paris-Saclay, Inria, and Criteo. A few recent publications reflective of my profile are Large Language Models as Markov Chains, Training Dynamics of Transformers, Generalization Prediction under Distribution Shifts, and SAMformer: SOTA model in time series forecasting. 

Before that, I obtained my master's degree at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in 2023 from the Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) program. I also hold an engineering degree from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in mathematics and computer science.

I maintain a research blog called <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/">logB<a/>  with my friend <a href="https://www.oussamazekri.fr/">Oussama Zekri<a/>. Feel free to check it out ðŸ™ƒ. Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
