I am a Ph.D. student between Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Inria, CNRS, IRISA and University of Rennes 2 under the supervision of [Ievgen Redko](https://ievred.github.io/), [Romain Tavenard](https://rtavenar.github.io/research/bio.html) and [Laetitia Chapel](https://people.irisa.fr/Laetitia.Chapel/). My research currently focuses on Deep Learning, Transformers, optimization, and distribution shifts.

I graduated from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in 2023 and hold a master's degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)). I did my master's thesis in semi-supervised learning at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab under the supervision of [Ievgen Redko](https://ievred.github.io/) and [Vasilii Feofanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasilii-feofanov-70748a1b3?originalSubdomain=fr).

Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
