I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Paris between Huawei Noah's Ark Lab & Inria supervised by <a href="https://rtavenar.github.io/research/bio.html">Romain Tavenard</a>, <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Laetitia.Chapel/">Laetitia Chapel</a>, and <a href="https://ievred.github.io/">Ievgen Redko</a>. 

I am interested in better understanding transformers by conducting theoretical study and large-scale experiments on:
- Large language models (e.g., [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02724) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20755?))
- Transformers training and finetuning (e.g.,  [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02362?) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24050))
- Out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/odonnat24a/odonnat24a.pdf), [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/49abf767d606b72f74ea6009176fafeb-Paper-Conference.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08909))
- Vision Transformers and Time Series forecasting (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198))

I was lucky to receive an ICML Oral Award, an ICASSP Oral Award, and a QBIN Best Flash Talk Award for my research in these areas. On a more amusing (and surprising 🙃) note, one of my recent articles was featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/11/11/revealing-secrets-of-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-via-old-fashioned-markov-chain-mathematics/">Forbes</a>.

I enjoy working both with a few collaborators and as part of a larger team, contributing to open-source libraries and communicating about my research. I maintain a research blog, <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/">logB<a/>, and have had the privilege to present my research at leading institutions such as EPFL, Cohere, ENS Ulm, and Criteo. 

I graduated from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in 2023 and hold a master's degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
