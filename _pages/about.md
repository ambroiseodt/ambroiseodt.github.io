I am Ambroise Odonnat, a first-year Ph.D. student at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and Inria working on transformers and distribution shifts.

I leverage various mathematical tools to better understand and empirically improve Transformers in settings where training and test data distributions differ. I am also interested in the optimization of neural networks. 

Previously, I obtained my master's degree at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in 2023 from the Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) program. I also hold an engineering degree from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in mathematics and computer science. 

I maintain a research blog called <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/">logB<a/>  with my friend <a href="https://www.oussamazekri.fr/">Oussama Zekri<a/>. Feel free to check it out ðŸ™ƒ. Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
