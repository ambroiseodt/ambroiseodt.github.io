I am a Ph.D. student at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab & Inria, jointly supervised by <a href="https://rtavenar.github.io/research/bio.html">Romain Tavenard</a>, <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Laetitia.Chapel/">Laetitia Chapel</a>, and <a href="https://ievred.github.io/">Ievgen Redko</a>. 

My current research aims to improve the core understanding of Transformers, involving theoretical and large-scale experimental study on:
- Large language models
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Transformers training and fine-tuning
- Vision Transformers and Time Series forecasting

I also enjoy contributing to open-source libraries and communicating about my research. I maintain a research blog, <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/">logB<a/>, with my friend <a href="https://www.oussamazekri.fr/">Oussama Zekri<a/>, and have  had the privilege to present my research at leading institutions such as EPFL, ENS Ulm, and Criteo.

Thanks to all my collaborators, I was lucky to receive an ICML Oral Award, a NeurIPS Spotlight Award, and a QBIN Best Flash Talk Award. On a more amusing (and surprising ðŸ™ƒ) note, one of my recent articles was featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/11/11/revealing-secrets-of-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-via-old-fashioned-markov-chain-mathematics/">Forbes</a>.

Doing research between industry and academia has taught me both to collaborate within a large-scale team and to be more autonomous in more focused groups.

I graduated from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in 2023 and hold a master's degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
