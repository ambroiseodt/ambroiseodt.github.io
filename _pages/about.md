I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning and deep learning in Paris between Huawei Noah's Ark Lab & Inria. I have the honour of being jointly supervised by <a href="https://rtavenar.github.io/research/bio.html">Romain Tavenard</a>, Pr. <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Laetitia.Chapel/">Laetitia Chapel</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://ievred.github.io/">Ievgen Redko</a>. My research aims to understand better LLMs and transformers, notably under distribution shifts and OOD generalization.

Before the Ph.D., I obtained my master's degree at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) in 2023 from the Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) program. I also hold an engineering degree from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech) in mathematics and computer science.

I maintain a research blog called <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/">logB<a/>  with my friend <a href="https://www.oussamazekri.fr/">Oussama Zekri<a/>. Feel free to check it out ðŸ™ƒ. Don't hesitate to reach out for possible collaborations or questions regarding my research!
