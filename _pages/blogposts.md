I maintain a research blog called <a href="https://logb-research.github.io/"> logB <a/>  with my friend <a href="https://www.oussamazekri.fr/"> Oussama Zekri <a/>. We discuss our research, papers we love, and mathematical tricks we use daily. Feel free to check it out and don't forget to subscribe to the mailing list to be notified whenever a new blogpost is released.
