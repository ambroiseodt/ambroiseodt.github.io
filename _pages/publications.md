Thanks to all my collaborators, I had the chance to see some of my contributions appear in venues such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AISTATS, and ICASSP and to receive an ICML Oral Award, a NeurIPS Spotlight Award, and a Best Flash Talk Award at QBIN. On a more amusing (and surprising ðŸ™ƒ) note, one of my recent articles was featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/11/11/revealing-secrets-of-large-language-models-and-generative-ai-via-old-fashioned-markov-chain-mathematics/">Forbes</a>.

I also had the privilege to present my research at leading institutions such as EPFL, ENS Ulm, ENS Lyon, ENS Paris-Saclay, and Criteo.
